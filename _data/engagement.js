                comment: `Wouldn't site rendered links have somewhat of the same downside as the manual method? In that you still need to at least remember to *regenerate* the site if the webring changes.<br><br>Another method is using an iframe. Not easily styleable with CSS, and makes a request to the webring host for every user, but does allow for easy updating by the webring host. For a webring I was a part of, I used to do that, but moved to basically site rendered links (only I was given HTML, not json, so I just included it directly in the homepage), because of reliability and privacy reasons (I don't like my site having a dependency on any third party resources if I can help it).<br><br>Though I guess you could automatically build and upload your site on a cron job every once in a while. That or fetch and render the links in javascript? (Kinda the iframe method, only easier to style. Requires JS though, which isn't great)`,

I'm spoiled with old fashioned Wordpress: comments are basically boiled in.<br><br>I must admit, though, that I find it kind of strange to come to the bottom of a post without seeing any mechanism for a comment.
