Once upon a time, I was born. ðŸ˜±

I am AMAB (assigned male at birth) and I've never nad a problem with that. As I've gotten older and learned more about other people's experiences, I did spend some time thinking about whether I might be trans. After lots of reflection, I decided that I wasn't. I was born male, and I don't have a problem with that.

Early this year, I discovered a character that a friend had designed, and I kinda fell in love. I ended up getting the fursuit my friend made for the character, and things just... sparked! After years of feeling "meh" about it, fursuiting was bright and fun again, I picked up drawing again, and it was generally a refreshing time in my life. It was also around the time that I retired my old fursona and decided to represent myself with a (nonbinary) protogen named Cascade instead.

And now I wonder: Why is it that I sparked so much with Suika? Why did I feel like switching my Bluesky profile to be her online for the month? Did I miss something when I considered my gender identity years before? So I was questioning again.

I'll spare the long, broad survey of possibilities I researched and considered. These are the questions that ended up leading me to an answer:

- Do I feel male? 100%.
- Do I feel female? Like 50-60%.
- Do I feel a third gender? Not really. I have a hard time conceptualizing what it would feel like.

There's a whole string of various gender terms that would work. Anything as broad as nonbinary or as specific as androgyne would work. I know I don't need to pick one and stick to it, but it does help to have one or two terms in the back pocket, for short bios or quick communication.

<p>Among the options that I think apply to me include: Nonbinary, multigender, transgender, bigender, cogender, cofluid, androgyne, and probably others too.</p>

## So... What Then?

Long story short (too late), I ended up settling on bigender. (âš¨)

I use any pronouns you like. (Though in the context of Suika, big bonus points for she/her, or if you pull out the "good girl" card :3)

I'm male, and I don't have a problem with that. I'm also partially female, and I don't have a problem with that either.
