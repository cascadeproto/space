I wrote a whole other post today. This one was private though. No peeking. ðŸ¤«

I've always known about the benefits of keeping journals. It wasn't until sometime last year that I really internalized some of those things. For example:

This is your brain:

<img data-transform="true"
  src="https://cdn.protogen.gg/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_4287-1.jpg" 
  alt="A massive scribble"
 />

This is your brain on journaling:

<img data-transform="true"
  src="https://cdn.protogen.gg/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_4288-1.jpg" 
  alt="It starts as a scribble, then a simpler line emerges from the mess"
 />

Even if it's just stream-of-consciousness word salad, the act of writing or typing out what you're thinking takes your thoughts and puts them down in a clean linear thing, a sentence. It's some of the cheapest, best therapy there is.

Here's another thing. Journaling is writing. Sure, no one sees it, the writing happened - it helps set a writing habit too!

I'm sure there's a lot more about this someone more knowledgeable than I can say, but these thoughts are mine.
