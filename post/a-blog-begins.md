I've lost count. This is the *nth* blog/website I've made, hoping that this'll be the one. The one that doesn't get abandoned, that regularly gets posted on, that actually can serve as a home for all my web experiments and the one that doesn't get trashed in a bout of ADHD that has me convinced I've found a better way to do it only to end up deleting everything and starting fresh with the same setup as before.

So why is this the one? What sets this site apart from all the others I've made? The answer, mostly, is hope. Also, a few rules I've set for myself.

## The Rules

### Achievable Regularity

The main reason I felt able to tear down old sites is that I've gone so long without posting that I didn't feel connected to the site anymore. Of all these rules, the big one is that I'm to post something substantial at least once a month. I'm going to let my future conscience decide what "substantial" means, but for now, examples might be a blog post, a new project page, or a design overhaul. Something major, not little bug fixes and design tweaks.

### Embrace Mistakes

I'm not perfect, and no one is. But a previous version of me felt that the writing I put out into the world could be. That, I realize now, is a giant pile of bullshit. So I'm allowing mistakes, imperfections, and bugs here. Not that broken things won't get fixed, but I will be celebrating the corrections publicly with updates to the posts and projects as things get fixed.

This is my site. No one cares more about it than me. But at the same time, no one cares more about the actual place I live than me, and it's a constant struggle keeping it clean and running too. Expect a dirty room now and then. It makes it homey.

### No Theme

There will be no theme connecting the pages and posts on this site. I'm not going to keep myself from posting about an exciting day of recipe development just because I think of this as a tech blog or a web development blog. This is a personal site, which means the only common theme is... me!

This new schedule of something posted every month will begin in May. I think I have an idea for the first thing to write about: the process of making the site itself! I may start posting some short stories too. You'll just have to wait till then to see. Check those socials, or subscribe to the site feed to see the updates as they happen. Till then!
