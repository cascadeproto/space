I discovered the [concept of Blaugust](https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/) exactly one (1) week ago. The idea of a challenge to blog something every day during the month of August, even if I'm not perfect about it, intrigues me, because it means more blog in the world! So as crazy as it is, I'm gonna try it. I've never once finished one of these daily-thing-for-a-month challenges, but there's always room for a first.

If you have a blog you haven't used in a while, never blogged before at all, or maybe you're already a daily posting machine, give this thing a shot! I like that there aren't really any rules other than "give it a go," which speaks more to my way of thinking. I also like that there's prompt lists everywhere - not just the official one. Coming up with something to write about is often the hardest part for me, and even if I don't end up posting what today's prompt was about, at least it greased the wheels and got me writing something, which will often turn into it's own stream of ideas.

If you haven't blogged before ever and you're even a little bit tempted, welcome aboard! There's no wrong way to start. The easiest way to get off the ground would be to head over to [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) or [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com), make an account, and just start putting thoughts out there.

What I love about the web is that nothing is set in stone. As you learn more, get better, and notice features you want, you can expand what those platforms are capable of, move between them, build your own, whatever! My site has had more iterations than I can count, and I hated most of them, but it's not an impossible task to just, change it!

Since it is tradition of sorts to kick off this month with an introduction to Blaugust and all that, I should introduce myself properly as well.

## Hello!

I'm Cascade! I'm one of those crazy furries you (don't) hear about. [That's me on the home page!](https://cascading.space/) I'm demisexual (asexual but more complicated lol), and my pronouns are whatever you decide to use - I'll answer to anything.

I'm always open to chat! I love chatting, I'm just not good at keeping a digital conversation going over the course of days and weeks. If you're the type to send out random memes, I'm happy to read them! I'm on [Telegram](https://t.me/cascadingspace) and [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/jxgYKzxfauPAqawTEgeeeqaXcs4oppAoCt3gq4MKcfaNPBimunVLQKNZy9ZOydwy) - these and my social links are in the footer too.

I have a host of other characters as well - sometimes I'll be them online, and they'll probably make guest appearances as the month goes on. But mostly I'm that protogen - the fox-looking robot thing up there.

I spend my time gaming, drawing, web designing, and spending time with my family. And blogging - this month, anyway! More on all that later in the month - don't want to run out of steam too early.

Now off I go to schedule some posts while I got the momentum. Till tomorrow!
